# AI-Driven Cardiovascular Valve Repair Nanobot

## Project Overview
This repository contains the complete design files for an AI-powered nanobot system designed for minimally invasive cardiovascular valve repair. The system combines advanced nanotechnology with artificial intelligence to perform precise diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in heart valve tissue.

## Components
The nanobot system consists of several key components, each designed for specific functions:

### Core Systems
- **AI Core**: Central processing unit that manages decision-making and operation coordination
- **Power Source**: Self-contained energy system for autonomous operation
- **Outer Shell**: Biocompatible housing protecting internal components
- **Communication Antenna**: Enables real-time data transmission and reception

### Operational Components
- **Propulsion System**: Dual-component design (Propulsion 1 & 2) for precise navigation
- **Pressure Sensor**: Monitors local blood pressure and flow dynamics
- **Reservoir System**: 
  - Holder for secure storage
  - Main reservoir for therapeutic agents
  - Depository nozzle for controlled release

### Therapeutic Elements
- **Stimulation Electrodes**: Deliver targeted electrical impulses for tissue regeneration
- **Core Hold**: Stabilization mechanism during procedures
- **Reservoir Holder**: Secure containment system for therapeutic agents
